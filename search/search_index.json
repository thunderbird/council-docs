The Council works alongside the MZLA company board and helps keep the project aligned with open source values and the Mozilla mission.</p> <p>The Council ensures that Thunderbird remains true to its core values of privacy, freedom, and user empowerment. Established in 2014, it serves as the voice of the community and encourages a collaborative space for contributors. It is composed of seven members who are elected by the Thunderbird community.</p> <p>The Council typically meets one hour every two weeks. We aim to have at least one in-person meeting per year, which can be attached to a MZLA/Mozilla company event like MozWeek or a meetup around an open source tech conference like FOSDEM.</p>"},{"location":"#relationship-to-mozilla-and-mzla","title":"Relationship to Mozilla and MZLA","text":"<p>The Thunderbird project is a part of the Mozilla ecosystem.

If there is no consensus, changes can be made in the goals developed for the subsequent year.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Conflict Resolution</p> </li> </ul> <p>It is expected that the Council and MZLA should typically resolve disputes via mutual conversation and collaboration. Nevertheless, there is the potential for unresolvable conflicts. Should this occur, conflicts will be resolved by the following process unless otherwise specified in the document:</p> <p>Should one party be unhappy with the handling of any of the collaboration or decision making mentioned in this document, it may send notice to the other party noting the two parties are in a dispute. The party receiving the notice will respond with a proposed resolution of the issue within 14 days, and within the limits of rest of the Term Sheet.</p> <p>Should the party providing notice not be satisfied with the resolution, it will provide in writing a counter proposal. If the counter proposal is not accepted, either party may opt to pass a resolution appealing to an independent party to resolve the dispute.</p> <p>After six months, should either party still be unsatisfied with the resolution either party may invoke a process to separate the Thunderbird project from MZLA. In this case, the Council will remain the governing body of the Thunderbird software project, under the Mozilla Module Ownership system, subject to the rules of that system.</p>"},{"location":"decisions/motions/","title":"Council Motion History","text":"<p>Council motions are used for formal decision making in the Thunderbird Council.

We aim to make most effective use of this     budget rather than trying to spend it all.</li> <li>$2,000 for elections, such as voting platform costs and campaigning</li> <li>$2,000 as contingency</li> </ul> <p>Should further budget be necessary for 2026 initiatives, we will make an additional motion in a timely fashion, or check if additional contingency is available from MZLA. In case not, we can focus on defining them by the end of 2026, and executing them in 2027.</p>2026-01-23Proposed: PhilippSeconded: PatrickYes: Magnus, Mic, Patrick, Philipp, Tim MaksNo: TealTeal<p>I voted no because I preferred an amendments driven revision of the original budget proposal consistent with my understanding of our Bylaws practice, and while this version restored some valuable items (including training and community building), it removed spending details and reimbursement specificity and deferred a key inclusivity/disparity reduction item to a future standalone motion, which in my view makes that goal harder to achieve and represents a step backward from last year\u2019s progress.</p> \ud83d\udfe2 Approved<p>The Council has decided to focus on an approach for the new term sheet focusing on proposals and vetos instead of their classical budgets and roadmaps. Proposals are made to MZLA and shared transparently, where MZLA must respond. However, they are also able to reject proposals.</p> <p>Vetos are used when MZLA takes an action the council disagrees with. The vetoed action must align with a core principal, to be defined. The core principals will be similar to the Mozilla Manifesto. The bar for a veto is likely to be higher, e.g. a 2/3rds majority.</p> <p>After a veto, if MZLA feels that the decision could endanger its sustainability, it can ask for an arbitration. The arbitration panel is selected at the start of a council term and consists of one MZLA chosen participant, one Council chosen participant, and one jointly chosen participant.</p> <p>The proposal mechanism will also be used to suggest roadmap items to MZLA. The council must have a chance to review the roadmaps produced by MZLA, and uses the veto mechanism to reject roadmap items. Budget and staff leadership will play a secondary role.</p> <p>This vote is simply to agree on the direction. Further votes will occur to agree on the final terms, which subsequently need to be agreed on with the MZLA board.</p>2026-01-13Proposed: PhilippSeconded: MicYes: Mic, Patrick, Philipp, Tim MaksNo: TealAbstain: MagnusTeal<p>I voted no because I believe shifting Council influence from collaborative roadmap/budget negotiation to a proposal/veto model would make routine requests harder in practice (especially for volunteer led work), because I prefer the Term Sheet WG present multiple distinct options for Council and Community evaluation before committing to a direction, and because I have concerns about the appearance of conflict of interest when Council leadership simultaneously holds MZLA leadership responsibilities in decisions that materially affect the Council\u2013MZLA balance of authority.</p> \ud83d\udfe2 Approved<p>Approve the  2026 Services Roadmap, as described in this document.</p>2025-12-23Proposed: MagnusSeconded: TealYes: Magnus, Mic, Patrick, Teal, Tim MaksAbstain: Philipp \ud83d\udfe2 Approved<p>The Council approves making changes to the bylaws in order to improve asynchronous communication and solidify current practices.
