The Council operates much like a board of directors for a company but within the unique context of an open-source project. Just as a board of directors is responsible for overseeing the company's strategic direction, making major decisions, and ensuring the organization's financial health, the Thunderbird Council performs a similar role for the Thunderbird Project. The Council ensures that Thunderbird remains true to its core values of privacy, freedom, and user empowerment. Established in 2014, the Council acts as the voice of the community, guiding the project's strategic direction and fostering a collaborative environment for all contributors. The Council is composed of seven members and is elected by the Thunderbird community. The Council typically meets one hour every two weeks. We aim to have at least one in-person meeting per year, which can be attached to a MZLA/Mozilla company event like MozWeek or a meetup around an open source tech conference like FOSDEM . Relationship to Mozilla and MZLA The Thunderbird project is jointly stewarded by the Thunderbird Council and MZLA Technologies. MZLA Technologies Corporation is a subsidiary to the Mozilla Foundation, and is the legal entity responsible for Thunderbird's operations. The company was created following discussions between former councils and the Mozilla Foundation, in order to provide the necessary structure for Thunderbird to operate professionally. The Council works closely with MZLA to set and adjust the long term strategic direction. Per our Term Sheet , the Thunderbird Council is responsible for: * Oversight of the Thunderbird Project * Oversight of funds and donations * Developing overall yearly goals * Approving the yearly project budget * Developing and approving the yearly product roadmap * Providing advice on and approving the yearly staff goals For more information about the Council, see this video with Council members Danny and Patrick .
