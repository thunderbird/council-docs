# Council Working Groups
Council working groups (CWGs) are a way to improve focus and effectiveness. Reaching consensus in
a group of seven can be difficult, but smaller groups working on specific topics tend to produce
stronger proposals that are more likely to pass a council vote.

The purpose of a CWG is to explore a topic and bring a clear recommendation back to the full
council. CWGs are not decision-making bodies. Their role is to develop recommendations that
reflect the best interests of the project, consider the broader community, and can gain support
from fellow council members.

Each CWG begins with a charter. This sets the stage by defining what the group will work on and
how. The charter should include enough detail to align expectations, but not so much that it
creates unnecessary debate before the work begins.

## Council Webpage Working Group

<table>

<tr><td valign="top">Timeframe</td><td>March 15, 2025–July 15, 2025</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Participants</td><td>Mic, Philipp, Teal</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Purpose</td><td><p>There has been a perceived lack of external information about what the council is, what it
does, and why one should get involved. We aim to create a page that gives a high level
overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the Council is and what it does</li>
<li>How one can get involved and join the join the election roll</li>
<li>How the Council relates to MZLA, the MZLA board, Mozilla, the Mozilla Corporation
  (MoCo), the Mozilla Foundation (MoFo) and the new nonprofit Mozilla Organization (MoOr?)</li>
<li>Link to important documents (bylaws, term sheet, election roll, community updates)</li>
<li>Provide contact information for the Council, as well as information about each member</li>
</ul></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Scope</td><td><ul>
<li>Devise a single page that provides a high level overview of the council</li>
<li>Work out what information needs to go onto the council page</li>
<li>Work with MZLA's MarComm Team to ensure the page resonates with our audience</li>
<li>Have MZLA's Services Team add the page to thunderbird.net</li>
<li>Find a good place for where to share additional information about the council and set up this page.</li>
</ul></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Goals</td><td><ul>
<li>Information that MZLA can turn into a council web page</li>
<li>Present a prototype for the page with additional information to the council and agree on necessary changes.</li>
</ul></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Risks</td><td><ul>
<li>If we pack too much information into the web page, we risk losing focus and not
  appealing to the community audience</li>
</ul></td></tr>

## Council New Term Sheet Working Group

<table>

<tr><td valign="top">Timeframe</td><td>June 09, 2025–December 31, 2025</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Participants</td><td>Mic, Philipp</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Purpose</td><td><p>The Council Term Sheet outlines the framework for interactions between the Council and
MZLA. Given MZLA’s significant growth in recent years, there is a recognized need to
update the Term Sheet to more accurately reflect the Council’s evolving role as a
strategic steering committee.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Scope</td><td><ul>
<li>Clarify the Council’s role as a strategic steering committee for MZLA.</li>
<li>Define the channels and frequency of interaction between the Council and MZLA leadership.</li>
<li>Establish clear expectations for the Council’s input on key initiatives and decisions.</li>
<li>Ensure alignment between the Council’s advisory function and MZLA’s long-term goals.</li>
</ul></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Goals</td><td><ul>
<li>Clarify and improve the Council’s strategic role and responsibilities with MZLA’s evolving priorities.</li>
<li>Update the Term Sheet to reflect how Thunderbird has grown, clearly outlining roles,
  responsibilities, and decision-making processes.</li>
<li>Improve coordination between the Council and MZLA leadership with clearer communication practices.</li>
</ul></td></tr>

## Council Bylaws Working Group

<table>

<tr><td valign="top">Timeframe</td><td>June 20, 2025–December 31, 2025</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Participants</td><td>Patrick, Tim Maks</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Purpose</td><td><p>Clarify the Council’s bylaws to improve internal and external processes to be more
efficient and transparent.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Scope</td><td><p>Clarify how the Council makes decisions. We roughly follows Robert’s Rules, but there are
some areas that could use clarification:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens if a Council member abstains?</li>
<li>How does voting asynchronously work?</li>
<li>How do we know when we’re ready to vote? Clarify the voting period.</li>
<li>General clarifications of how the process works. (Write the process down.)</li>
</ul></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Goals</td><td><p>One or more motions to update the bylaws.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Risks</td><td><p>The areas of improvement for the bylaws are somewhat unrelated, there’s a risk of being
unfocused. This will be mitigated by focusing on a single area of the bylaws at a time and
re-approve the scope each time.</p></td></tr>
