# Thunderbird Council

## Description

The Mozilla Thunderbird Council is the elected governing body for the Thunderbird Project. The Council operates much like a board of directors for a company but within the unique context of an open-source project. Just as a board of directors is responsible for overseeing the company's strategic direction, making major decisions, and ensuring the organization's financial health, the Thunderbird Council performs a similar role for the Thunderbird Project.

The Council ensures that Thunderbird remains true to its core values of privacy, freedom, and user empowerment. Established in 2014, the Council acts as the voice of the community, guiding the project's strategic direction and fostering a collaborative environment for all contributors. The Council is composed of seven members and is elected by the Thunderbird community.

The Council typically meets one hour every two weeks. We aim to have at least one in-person meeting per year, which can be attached to a MZLA/Mozilla company event like MozWeek or a meetup around an open source tech conference like [FOSDEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM).

## Relationship to Mozilla and MZLA
The Thunderbird project is jointly stewarded by the Thunderbird Council and MZLA Technologies. 

MZLA Technologies Corporation is a subsidiary to the Mozilla Foundation, and is the legal entity responsible for Thunderbird's operations. The company was created following discussions between former councils and the Mozilla Foundation, in order to provide the necessary structure for Thunderbird to operate professionally.

The Council works closely with MZLA to set and adjust the long term strategic direction. Per our [Term Sheet](https://github.com/thunderbird/council-docs/blob/main/TERM_SHEET.md), the Thunderbird Council is responsible for:
* Oversight of the Thunderbird Project
* Oversight of funds and donations
* Developing overall yearly goals
* Approving the yearly project budget
* Developing and approving the yearly product roadmap
* Providing advice on and approving the yearly staff goals

## Thunderbird Goals
In 2024, the Council created a list our highest priority goals, where there was unanimous agreement from participating members, in order to help guide our decisions and work with MZLA on developing the roadmaps:
Declare that a goal of the Thunderbird project is to increase the amount of digitally signed and end-to-end encrypted email exchanged by Thunderbird users on the public Internet
Continue to invest in open standards
Make end-to-end encryption a cornerstone of all our product and service offerings
Increase stability and correctness of the Thunderbird
Start a bug bounty program
Invest in improvements for chat to become a modern instant messaging application
Investigate newer forms of communication

See our [community update](https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/planning/Td85d2de142aee525/thunderbird-council-community-update-2024-h2) for the full list of goals and much more details. During the 2025-2026 term, the Council is planning to use our oversight authority to ensure that MZLA completes all of them in the next few years as intended.
