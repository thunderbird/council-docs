This complements MZLA\u2019s company board by ensuring that MZLA stays true to its open source values and the Mozilla mission.</p> <p>The Council ensures that Thunderbird remains true to its core values of privacy, freedom, and user empowerment. Established in 2014, the Council acts as the voice of the community, guiding the project's strategic direction and fostering a collaborative environment for all contributors. The Council is composed of seven members and is elected by the Thunderbird community.</p> <p>The Council typically meets one hour every two weeks. We aim to have at least one in-person meeting per year, which can be attached to a MZLA/Mozilla company event like MozWeek or a meetup around an open source tech conference like FOSDEM.</p>"},{"location":"#relationship-to-mozilla-and-mzla","title":"Relationship to Mozilla and MZLA","text":"<p>The Thunderbird project is a part of the Mozilla ecosystem.

If there is no consensus, changes can be made in the goals developed for the subsequent year.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Conflict Resolution</p> </li> </ul> <p>It is expected that the Council and MZLA should typically resolve disputes via mutual conversation and collaboration. Nevertheless, there is the potential for unresolvable conflicts. Should this occur, conflicts will be resolved by the following process unless otherwise specified in the document:</p> <p>Should one party be unhappy with the handling of any of the collaboration or decision making mentioned in this document, it may send notice to the other party noting the two parties are in a dispute. The party receiving the notice will respond with a proposed resolution of the issue within 14 days, and within the limits of rest of the Term Sheet.</p> <p>Should the party providing notice not be satisfied with the resolution, it will provide in writing a counter proposal. If the counter proposal is not accepted, either party may opt to pass a resolution appealing to an independent party to resolve the dispute.</p> <p>After six months, should either party still be unsatisfied with the resolution either party may invoke a process to separate the Thunderbird project from MZLA. In this case, the Council will remain the governing body of the Thunderbird software project, under the Mozilla Module Ownership system, subject to the rules of that system.</p>"},{"location":"decisions/motions/","title":"Council Motion History","text":"<p>Council motions are used for formal decision making in the Thunderbird Council.

But it is also   threatened by new   non-standards-based, closed and centralized messaging platforms. To prevent this   erosion, the public deserves an alternative that is secure and reliable, while   protecting our privacy, enhancing our productivity and serving as a platform for   current and future forms of messaging.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mission: Thunderbird facilitates cross platform, decentralized, open-standard   communication, which puts the user in control of their data and  workflow.
