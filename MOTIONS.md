communication and being a significant driver of freedom on the Internet. We further recognize
the need for interoperability, and feel this also extends to situations where the user is

objective is to extend the reach of the Project and to engage with users even on proprietary
protocols.</p>

non-standard protocols such as Exchange for use in situations where open-standard protocols
are not available.</p>

<p>Preamble: Email has been and continues to be the fundamental communication tool and
  a significant driver of freedoms on the Internet. But it is also   threatened by new
  non-standards-based, closed and centralized messaging platforms. To prevent this
  erosion, the public deserves an alternative that is secure and reliable, while
  protecting our privacy, enhancing our productivity and serving as a platform for
  current and future forms of messaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mission: Thunderbird facilitates cross platform, decentralized, open-standard
  communication, which puts the user in control of their data and  workflow. We aspire
  to offer an interoperable and extensible open-source platform for messaging and
  managing personal information, such as email, contacts, and appointments.</p>
