<table><tr><th>Outcome</th><th>Motion</th><th>Details</th><th>Votes</th><th>Statements</th>
<tr class="approved"><td valign="top">🟢 Approved</td><td valign="top"><p>The Council approves the charter renewing the Council Bylaws CWG with the purpose of updating the Bylaws to add a conflict of interest policy.</p></span></td><td valign="top">2026-01-25<br>Proposed: Patrick<br><br>Seconded: Tim Maks</td><td valign="top">Yes: Magnus, Patrick, Philipp, Teal, Tim Maks<br><br>Abstain: Mic</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr class="approved"><td valign="top">🟢 Approved</td><td valign="top"><p>The council approves the following items for the 2026 council budget, consisting of up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3,500 for professional training to work better together</li>
<li>$3,000 for community building, such as surveys and swag</li>
<li>$50,000 for travel, such as MozWeek, FOSDEM and an in-person event. We aim to make most effective use of this
    budget rather than trying to spend it all.</li>
<li>$2,000 for elections, such as voting platform costs and campaigning</li>
<li>$2,000 as contingency</li>
</ul>
<p>Should further budget be necessary for 2026 initiatives, we will make an additional motion in a timely fashion, or check if additional contingency is available from MZLA. In case not, we can focus on defining them by the end of 2026, and executing them in 2027.</p></span></td><td valign="top">2026-01-23<br>Proposed: Philipp<br><br>Seconded: Patrick</td><td valign="top">Yes: Magnus, Mic, Patrick, Philipp, Tim Maks<br><br>No: Teal</td><td valign="top"><details><summary>Teal</summary><p>I voted no because I preferred an amendments driven revision of the original budget proposal consistent with my understanding of our Bylaws practice, and while this version restored some valuable items (including training and community building), it removed spending details and reimbursement specificity and deferred a key inclusivity/disparity reduction item to a future standalone motion, which in my view makes that goal harder to achieve and represents a step backward from last year’s progress.</p></details></td></tr>
<tr class="approved"><td valign="top">🟢 Approved</td><td valign="top"><p>The Council has decided to focus on an approach for the new term sheet focusing on proposals and vetos instead of their classical budgets and roadmaps. Proposals are made to MZLA and shared transparently, where MZLA must respond. However, they are also able to reject proposals.</p>
<p>Vetos are used when MZLA takes an action the council disagrees with. The vetoed action must align with a core principal, to be defined. The core principals will be similar to the Mozilla Manifesto. The bar for a veto is likely to be higher, e.g. a 2/3rds majority.</p>
<p>After a veto, if MZLA feels that the decision could endanger its sustainability, it can ask for an arbitration. The arbitration panel is selected at the start of a council term and consists of one MZLA chosen participant, one Council chosen participant, and one jointly chosen participant.</p>
<p>The proposal mechanism will also be used to suggest roadmap items to MZLA. The council must have a chance to review the roadmaps produced by MZLA, and uses the veto mechanism to reject roadmap items. Budget and staff leadership will play a secondary role.</p>
<p>This vote is simply to agree on the direction. Further votes will occur to agree on the final terms, which subsequently need to be agreed on with the MZLA board.</p></span></td><td valign="top">2026-01-13<br>Proposed: Philipp<br><br>Seconded: Mic</td><td valign="top">Yes: Mic, Patrick, Philipp, Tim Maks<br><br>No: Teal<br><br>Abstain: Magnus</td><td valign="top"><details><summary>Teal</summary><p>I voted no because I believe shifting Council influence from collaborative roadmap/budget negotiation to a proposal/veto model would make routine requests harder in practice (especially for volunteer led work), because I prefer the Term Sheet WG present multiple distinct options for Council and Community evaluation before committing to a direction, and because I have concerns about the appearance of conflict of interest when Council leadership simultaneously holds MZLA leadership responsibilities in decisions that materially affect the Council–MZLA balance of authority.</p></details></td></tr>

objective is to extend the reach of the Project and to engage with users even on proprietary
protocols.</p>

non-standard protocols such as Exchange for use in situations where open-standard protocols
are not available.</p>

<p>Preamble: Email has been and continues to be the fundamental communication tool and
  a significant driver of freedoms on the Internet. But it is also   threatened by new
  non-standards-based, closed and centralized messaging platforms. To prevent this
  erosion, the public deserves an alternative that is secure and reliable, while
  protecting our privacy, enhancing our productivity and serving as a platform for
  current and future forms of messaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mission: Thunderbird facilitates cross platform, decentralized, open-standard
  communication, which puts the user in control of their data and  workflow. We aspire
  to offer an interoperable and extensible open-source platform for messaging and
  managing personal information, such as email, contacts, and appointments.</p>
