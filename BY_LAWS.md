## Mandate

The Thunderbird Council is the governing body for the Thunderbird project. The detailed duties and powers of the Thunderbird Council are described in the [Thunderbird Operational Rules Term Sheet](https://github.com/thunderbird/council-docs/blob/main/TERM_SHEET.md).

## Election Procedure

The Thunderbird Council shall meet immediately after their election for the purpose of electing its new officers.

The current election process is detailed below.

1. A list of persons eligible to vote (the "electors") shall be established by the existing Thunderbird Council, based on the section entitled “[Membership Eligibility](#eligibility)” below for how this is done. The names of the electors will be made public.
2. The list of electors will be entered into a private mailing list (currently known as tb-election) that will be created for the purpose of managing the Thunderbird Council election. All people with voting rights will be added to that list, and any discussion of the nominees and candidates, and any specific instructions on how to vote, will be distributed through that list and only through that list. Once the discussion period has started, all members of the list can post freely to the list (subject only to moderation for abusive posts) to discuss any issues relevant to the election.
3. Persons on the electorate list who desire to stand for election should send their self-announcement to the list, titled: “Standing for Election:”, stating in the body of the email:
    1. name;
    2. current professional affiliation (if any);
    3. a statement summarizing their contributions to Thunderbird; and
    4. a personal statement.
4. It is the responsibility of the person desiring to stand to make sure their message makes it to the list. No late self-announcements will be accepted for any reason.
5. In the case there are more than two people nominated from the same professional affiliation, a pre-election will take place first, and the two winners will continue to the real election. No single organization or company will be allowed to control more than 2 seats of the Council, regardless of election results. Mozilla Foundation, Mozilla Corporation, and MZLA Technologies Corporation are considered separate organizations.

   In the event that individuals affiliated with a corporation or organization hold more than 2 seats, affiliates from that corporation will be required to resign until more than 2 seats are no longer held.

   Individuals affiliated with a company or organization are people who are employees, officers, or members of the board of directors of an organization; or have a significant consulting relationship; or own at least 1% of the equity or debt, or derivatives thereof, of a company.
6. Electors shall vote for Thunderbird Council members from the list of those standing for election, with the specific method and process selected by a neutral third-party observer.
7. The voting process shall select a Thunderbird Council of seven members, each with a two-year term as described in sections “[Composition](#composition)” and “[Term](#term)”. Voting will occur on an external, secure voting-as-a-service platform. If more than seven people stand for election, voting will be done using “ranked choice”, with conversion of the individual choices into an elected Thunderbird Council done using the Scottish STV method.
8. If fewer than or equal to the nominal number of Councilors stand for election, then the voting shall consist of a simple yes or no to accept or decline the entire slate as the elected Thunderbird Council. If the answer is no, the election process is repeated until a slate is elected.

### Thunderbird Project Election Observer

#### Description:

The primary functions of the election "observer" during the election process are as follows:

1. Be an impartial party.
2. Privately or publicly raise concerns if any person - participant, election manager, or Thunderbird Council - acts improperly. And may also directly communicate with the Thunderbird Council and the public.
3. Approve the documented election process as proposed by the Thunderbird Council as being fair and correct.
4. Assures that the documented election process is actually properly applied throughout the election period.
5. Works closely with the Thunderbird Council appointed election manager(s).
6. The observer should setup, run and moderate the election mailing list to be able to fulfill their responsibility of observing and ensuring the process is properly and fairly applied. They may request the assistance of Thunderbird Council appointed “manager(s)” to setup, build, implement, and manage the election process, but the observer must have all the powers that the managers have AND be able to see all the moderation activity, all emails and all communications - to be able to fulfill their responsibility of observing and ensuring the process is properly and fairly applied.
7. (In this step, the observer is the primary driver) Be the ONLY person to administer the voting service, and run the vote. There must be no possibility for any other person to influence the election.
8. Announces the vote result.

It should also be noted that the CPG is to be observed throughout the process. It is not the observer's job to enforce the CPG, but it would be entirely proper to be involved in determining if CPG violations have occurred. The observer will need to engage with the CPG team if and when necessary during the process.

#### The number of hours:

This depends on the amount of discussion and controversy, if any, during the election period.

Typically it takes 5–10 hours in the 5–6 week period, if there are no election hurdles, but may take up to 15–20 hours

#### Pay:

This is a voluntary position, with non-monetary compensation.

### Election timetable

The election process will start on the first Monday of March every 2 years.

The election timetable shall run as follows:

1. Electoral roll created and published (January)
2. Announcement of the election on first Monday of March
3. Nominations to the Council (1 week)
4. Discussion period (1 week)
5. Pre-election voting period (1 week)
6. Voting period (1 week)
7. Results announced

## Membership

### Eligibility
